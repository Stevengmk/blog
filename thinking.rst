the most difficult thing in the world is "thinking", we can do anything if we can escape from it.

* when we are at school, we memorize the answers and default solutions instead of learning. and after the exam, nothing is left.
* when we are at work, we do only the boss told us to, instead of solve the problems, eventhough it can save us time.
* when after work, we go online for funny, instead of thinking how to use it.
* we follow our parents, we follow the society, instead of go our own path.
* we take others judgement, not our own.
* we use instinct directly, without make a thought.
* we look forward of master keys, silver bullet, leader, god, parents, even money, not ourselves.

how sad.
